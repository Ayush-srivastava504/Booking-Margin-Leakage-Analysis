# Booking Margin Leakage Analysis

## Executive Summary

Despite 15,000 bookings and $13.74M in gross revenue, 21% of bookings are loss-making. The platform loses approximately $2.6M annually due to cancellations, negative-margin segments, pricing inefficiencies, and geographic underperformance.

This dashboard identifies where margin is lost and why.

## Financial Snapshot

**Gross Booking Value:** $13.74M

* Platform & payment fees: $2.32M
* Host costs: $2.56M
* Expected margin: $8.86M (64.5%)

**Actual realized margin:** ~$5.1M (37.1%)

**Margin gap:** $3.76M (27.4% of GBV)

Key drivers:

* Cancellations: -$2.1M
* Loss-making bookings: -$0.54M
* Operational inefficiencies: material impact

## Core Business Problems

### 1. Profitability Disparity

* 21% of bookings lose money.
* Shared rooms and last-minute bookings frequently negative.
* No clear predictive pricing or segmentation strategy.

### 2. Cancellation Impact

* 1,231 cancellations.
* $2.1M margin loss.
* <3-day bookings have 15% cancellation rate vs 3% for 30+ days.
* High-margin, last-minute bookings are highest risk.

### 3. Segment Underperformance

* Shared rooms: structurally unprofitable (costs exceed price).
* Private rooms in budget areas: near break-even.
* Entire homes in premium markets: 50%+ margin.

### 4. Geographic Imbalance

High margin:

* San Francisco (~58%)
* Manhattan (~52%)

Low margin:

* Queens (~12%)
* Saturated secondary markets

40% of bookings come from low-margin areas.

### 5. Host Concentration Risk

* Top 20% of hosts generate 70%+ of margin.
* Bottom 50% generate ~10%.
* Revenue concentration increases churn risk.

## What the Dashboard Enables

* Clear visibility into margin leakage.
* Segment-level profitability comparison.
* Cancellation risk analysis by booking window.
* Host tier identification and retention focus.
* What-if simulations (pricing changes, cancellation reduction).

---

## Business Implications

Without corrective action:

* Continued $3–4M margin gap.
* Host churn in low-margin segments.
* Revenue concentration risk.
* Growth constraints due to weak unit economics.

With action:

* Targeted pricing strategies.
* Cancellation policy optimization.
* Segment restructuring.
* Geographic portfolio rebalancing.
* VIP retention for top hosts.

---

## Bottom Line

This is a unit economics problem, not a revenue problem.

The platform generates strong gross revenue but fails to convert it efficiently into sustainable margin. The dashboard provides the analytical foundation to close the $3.76M profitability gap.
