# Business Decisions – From Insights to Action

This document translates dashboard insights into prioritized actions to improve margin and reduce risk.

---

## Priority 1: Reduce Cancellations (High Impact)

**Problem**

* 1,231 cancellations
* 8.5% rate
* $2.1M annual margin loss
* 15% cancellation rate for <3-day bookings

**Recommended Action**

1. Implement stricter cancellation policy for last-minute bookings.
2. Introduce deposits or pricing premiums for <3-day lead times.

**Expected Impact**

* $210K–$420K incremental margin (policy change only).
* High ROI, low implementation effort.

**Timeline**
30 days.

## Priority 2: Restructure Shared Rooms

**Problem**

* 14.8% average margin.
* High loss concentration.
* Cleaning costs exceed pricing in many cases.

**Recommended Action**

1. Set price floors aligned with cost structure.
2. Enforce minimum 3-night stays.
3. Remove structurally unprofitable inventory.

**Expected Impact**

* $200K–$300K margin improvement.
* Converts loss segment into controlled contributor.

**Timeline**
60 days.

## Priority 3: Geographic Optimization

**Problem**

* Premium markets (SF, Manhattan) >50% margin.
* Budget markets (e.g., Queens) ~12% margin.
* 40% of bookings from weaker regions.

**Recommended Action**

1. Increase premium inventory allocation.
2. Reposition low-margin markets toward higher-value listings.
3. Limit budget inventory expansion.

**Expected Impact**
$100K–$300K margin improvement over 6–12 months.

## Priority 4: Protect Top Hosts

**Problem**

* Top 20% of hosts generate 70%+ of margin.
* Losing a few high performers materially impacts profitability.

**Recommended Action**
Launch a VIP host retention program:

* Commission discounts.
* Dedicated support.
* Marketing visibility.
* Early feature access.

**Expected Impact**

* $1M+ retained margin annually.
* Reduced churn from high-value hosts.

**Timeline**
6 weeks for pilot launch.

---

## Priority 5: Segment-Based Price Optimization

**Opportunity**

* 10% selective price increase yields ~$900K incremental margin.
* Premium segments show lower price sensitivity.

**Recommended Action**

* Increase entire home pricing 10–15%.
* Increase private rooms 5%.
* Hold shared rooms until profitability stabilizes.
* Test via controlled rollout.

**Expected Impact**
$600K–$1M incremental margin.

**Timeline**
8 weeks (test and expand).

---

## 90-Day Expected Impact

**Conservative (Top 3 initiatives):**
~$500K margin uplift.

**Most Likely (Top 4 initiatives):**
~$850K uplift.

**Optimistic (All initiatives):**
$1.5M–$1.8M uplift.

---

## Key Risks

* Reduced bookings due to stricter cancellation terms.
* Host resistance to pricing changes.
* Budget market competitive pressure.
* VIP program costs exceeding retention value.

Mitigation: phased rollout, pilot testing, performance tracking.

---

## Success Metrics

Track monthly:

* Cancellation rate (<7% target)
* Profitable bookings (>82%)
* Average margin (>40%)
* Shared room margin (>25%)
* Top host churn (<2%)
* Revenue per booking (stable or increasing)

---

## Conclusion

The platform’s issue is margin efficiency, not revenue scale.

The dashboard identifies over $2M in recoverable margin through:

* Cancellation control
* Segment restructuring
* Geographic focus
* Host retention
* Targeted pricing

Execution over the next 90 days determines whether this opportunity is captured or lost.
